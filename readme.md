# Final project code repository
### Requirements:
- python3
- numpy

### OUTPUT ON Ubuntu:
```
$ python3 part1.py
part1.py
[-1.  2.  2.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.] Are the eigen values of the chao matrix in file chaomat.txt
We can see that there is a negative eigen value, proving to us that the map is not completely positive

$ python3 part2.py
part2.py
The threshold value after binary search is : 0.25

$ python3 part3.py
part2.py
The threshold value after binary search is : 0.5
```

### OUTPUT ON Windows:    
```    
$ python part1.py
